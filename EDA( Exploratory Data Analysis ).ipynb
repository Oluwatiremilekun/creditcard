Data pre-processing, Feature Engineering, and EDA are fundamental early steps after data collection. Still, they are not limited to where the data is simply visualized, plotted, and manipulated, without any assumptions, to assess the quality of the data and building models. This article will guide you through data pre-processing, feature engineering, and EDA using Python."
